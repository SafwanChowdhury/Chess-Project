            <h2>About Chess</h2>
            <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The game is played by millions of people worldwide and has a rich history dating back over a thousand years. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.</p>

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <p>Each type of chess piece has its unique way of moving. A player can make one move per turn, capturing the opponent's piece or making a strategic move. Players should try to control the center of the board, develop their pieces, and protect their king while seeking opportunities to attack the opponent's king.</p>
            
            <h3>Basic Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>White always moves first.</li>
                <li>A player can't make a move that puts their own king in check.</li>
                <li>If a king is in check, the player must make a move to remove the threat.</li>
                <li>If a player has no legal moves and their king is in check, it's checkmate, and the game is over.</li>
                <li>If a player has no legal moves and their king is not in check, it's a stalemate, and the game is a draw.</li>
            </ul>
