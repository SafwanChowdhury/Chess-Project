            <h2>About the Online Chess Game</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Online Chess Game! Immerse yourself in the magical world of wizarding chess, where you can play with players from around the globe. Our platform provides an enchanting experience with a unique Harry Potter-inspired design and engaging gameplay.</p>

            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <p>Each type of chess piece has its unique way of moving. A player can make one move per turn, capturing the opponent's piece or making a strategic move. Players should try to control the center of the board, develop their pieces, and protect their king while seeking opportunities to attack the opponent's king. In our online platform, you can join a game, create a lobby, or explore various game options to enhance your chess experience.</p>

            <h3>Basic Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>White always moves first.</li>
                <li>A player can't make a move that puts their own king in check.</li>
                <li>If a king is in check, the player must make a move to remove the threat.</li>
                <li>If a player has no legal moves and their king is in check, it's checkmate, and the game is over.</li>
                <li>If a player has no legal moves and their king is not in check, it's a stalemate, and the game is a draw.</li>
            </ul>
